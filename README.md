# Scratch Assets Converter [ZIP > SB3] 
**An Python3 script for converting the entire assets **(images and sounds)** into an .sb3 file.**

How to use:
- Step 1. Have a folder named `assets` with a ton of image and sound files, with a json file called `project.json`
- Step 2. Drag the project.json file to another position (MUST not inside the assets folder)
- Step 3. Download zip at [here](https://github.com/TuBeo5866/turbowarp-asset-to-sb3/releases/tag/v1.0.0), and extract it.
- Step 4. Open the script:
     + For Windows: open `start packing.bat` as admin
         1. press any key to edit `packing.py`, follow as it says
         2. get back to command window, press again any key
     + For Linux: (needs Python 3.10 or newer installed) open terminal
         1. make it can run by enter command: `chmod +x "start packing".sh`
         2. and run it: `"./start packing.sh"`
    - the script will do its work, all you have to is to wait. It may take a few seconds or more, due to the size of the assets.
    - after doing, your project will be extracted and completely made, as your ```output-dir``` have been set.
